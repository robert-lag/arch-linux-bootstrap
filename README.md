# Arch Linux Bootstrap

This is a script that I use to automatically setup any arch linux system
according to my configurations.

It downloads all packages I regularly use, my scripts and dotfiles and
configures various settings on the pc.

Feel free to use it for yourself (or copy sections of it), take note however,
that this script is only intended for my personal use case, so it might not be
compatible with your system.
